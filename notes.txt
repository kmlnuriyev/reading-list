SPRING BOOT IN ACTION

1. Created the model class with @Entity annotation - Book.java

2. Created the repository interface (ReadingListRepository.java) which extends JpaRepository (JpaRepository<Book, Long>) interface

3. Created ReadingListController to add the reader into the book and retrieve the list of books of selected reader

4. Created readingList.html and added xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:th="http://thymeleaf.org" into the HTML tag;
I have deleted 'www' from xmlns for thymeleaf because the error 'Cannot resolve ...'.

5. We are going to add security dependency to the application.
